Method Description:
Item Based CF with LSH: Firstly I am generating all the similar businesses using Locality Sensitive Hashing Algorithm with Jaccard Similarity.
Then I am filtering the obtained similar pairs and selecting only those whose Jaccard similarity measure is greater than or equal to 0.5.
Lastly, I am applying Item Based Collaborative Filtering with Pearson Correlation Coefficient along with LSH, taking the advantage of similar pairs generated.
Here, we are matching user's rated business to similar businesses.
Item Based CF with LSH runs faster and provides better recommendations.
Key idea is that similar businesses will be rated similarly by the same user.
