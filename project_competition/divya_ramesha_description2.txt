Method Description:
* For the final project I have used a python library called Surprise. The name Surprise stands for Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine.
* We can install surprise library using "pip install scikit-surprise"
* Surprise is a Python scikit library for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.
* I have used BaselineOnly recommendation algorithm in Surprise library.
* Some users give higher ratings than others and some items receive higher ratings than others. We encapsulate these effects within the baseline estimates.
* Algorithm predicting the baseline estimate for given user and business:
    rating(user, business) = overall_average_rating + deviation(user) + deviation(business)
